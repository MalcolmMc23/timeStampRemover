chapter 10. you better come now that perhaps have returned he wanted

to be with us all five of us together all that time he hurted us into the kitchen and gave

us big knives to chop up the onions and cilantro while he picked through the dry beans and boiled the rice and marched

out at him and smelled the air and set on swings after dinner he led us all to the

bathtub no bubbles just six inch of gray water and our bare butts our knees and

elbows and our three little dicks perhaps Square bus rough with a soapy

washcloth he dug his fingernails into our scalp as he washed our hair it

warned us that if the shampoo got into our eyes it was her own fault for screwing

we made multiple noises navigating bits of the

styrofoam around toothpicks and plastic milk caps islands and we try to be brave

when he grabbed us we try not to Flinch ma was leaning over the sink

peering into the mirror pulling out her eyebrows and curling her eyelashes with

a shiny metal instruments being gentle she said well I even

looking at him without even blinking her eyes they were both topless ma was in a Flash

colored bra and heavy cotton work pants and paps has taken off his shirt to wash

us we saw everything how our skin was darker than Moss but lighter than pops

our mouth was like was like in nipple with ribs softly stepping down from her

breasts and how paps was muscled and the muscles and

tendons of his forearms the veins in his hands

the Nikki hair spreading across his chest he was

like an animal Our Father Woody and physical and insective

his shoulders honked hug and curve and we had each of us even ma

sat on them gone for rides my shoulders were clipped and slipping

away from her Tiny Bird neck she was just over five feet and light enough for

Manny to lift and when pops called her fragile he's sometimes meant for us to take an extra special care with her and

he sometimes meant that she was easily broken Pap stood to piss and we saw his

Stout fleshy dick the darkness of his skin down there and

the strong jet of urine loud and loud and punched

turned from the mirror and we saw her watching him too he sipped up and stood behind her then slide his hands under

her bra and mounds of Flesh wool and squished between his fingers it made us

giggity it made her giddy even though she puts them away they were playing

with each other and no one wanted to leave the bathroom nobody wants it to fight or Splash a room the moment

perhaps lean against the wall and watched her adjusting herself back into her hardness he grinned and he growled

we watched him watching her we study his hunger and we knew he were seeing and

understanding now he winked at us he wanted us to know what she made him happy that's my girl he said slapping

her bottom ain't no other like her we're gonna catch uh pneumonia

ma says so he fished us out of the tub one at a time and stood us on the toilet

seat and tell us try he grabbed our ankles and dried the undersides of our feet and we had to

hold on to his shoulder for balance or Grab A Fistful of his afro he ran the

towel between our toes our back cracks our armpits and tickling us but acting

as he wouldn't comprehend what was so ticklish he tried our heads for a long time until

we were smarting and dizzy each time paps finished drawing one of us he would

place our Palm against his own Palm he didn't say anything to Joelle or Manny but my hand he hit up a little longer

looking close and nodding his head you grew he said and I smiled and

straightened my back brought in my shoulders triumphant

mom and pop started talking to each other about our bodies about how quickly we were changing the joke about needing

to make some more boys to take our place we watched them they look at each other in the eyes teasing and laughing their

words were warm and soft and we snuggle into the gentliness of the conversation

we were all together in a bathroom in this moment and nothing was wrong my

brothers and I were clean and fed and not afraid of going up we climbed back into the empty tub still in our towels

and our parents pretend not to know this we saw them pretending and it thrilled us we slide

the shower curtain closed and huddled together looking at each other with wide open in your eyes hey wait a minute pop

said in a mock surprise where did the boys go we press our face into our cheeks to

keep back the giggles oh my mom said they just disappeared we clinch

ourselves together into a tighter ball our knees stands for excitement they're

going to find us and maybe they scare us he came back the curtain and shouting gotcha

mom maybe they scoop us up and tickle us maybe they should be sneaky and stand on

the rim of the top and peek over the top of the curtain I'm waiting for us to notice maybe they like

War like dinosaurs maybe they borrow us maybe pops will take Joelle under one

arm and many on the other and Mama will grab me and swing me in a circle but whatever happened we will be

found my brothers and me hotter together they will grab and take us up and into

their arms and own us but then it didn't look for us at all they found each other instead we

listened to the kissing and soft little moans and after a while we got them on

our knees lifting up the bottom edge of the shower curtain and spying on them Ma was

balanced on the sink her back to the mirror and her legs falling around Pop's waist to drag her fingers up and down

his back her hands were little and light with painted fingernails that Trace ridges into popped skin

perhaps hands seemed massive on her tiny frame he clutched her hips moving her

towards and then away from him steadily steadily squeezing hard enough so that

his fingers appear to be sinking into her size like into a quicksand when I

look at her face she looked like she was in pain but she didn't look fighting like it was kind of a pain she wanted

we saw everything the Pabst Blue Jeans were fit into a spot where he kept his wallet the muscles of his stomach

the Amaya closed her eyes but perhaps kept his open the icky bit

right the way they were both creeping ties the mom's ankles were crossing her

toes were pointed her legs clutch and release him he was leaning her back so

that her skin touched the skin of her reflection like a picture I once saw of the semi twins

the faucet poke into the base of her spine and it must have hurt her or it must have hurt her because pops was

bigger and healthier and he was rough with her just like how he was well with

us we saw that must have hurt her too to love him perhaps lean Mom all the way back her

hair mixing and reflecting doubting itself in the mirror he bite into her neck like an apple and she wore her head

over and spotted us she smiled she pulled pops head away from her and turning him until he spotted us to I

thought you'd disappear he said you were supposed to look for us said Manny I guess I found something better than pop

said and Mom stepping on the chest calling my bastard she'll wrap herself

by ma'am and fidget with her clothes and smooth her hair he tried to kiss her

neck again but she wiggled away get my boots from the closet she said please Papi I'm already late we have signed and

sank on to our butts but the moment pop slipped the bathroom might turn off the light and shut the door and got the to

the top with us pulling the curtain clothes behind her it was completely dark we couldn't even see her but we

couldn't but we could be her arms around us her hair tickling my bare shoulders we'll show him mom said and we left her

then fires piercilly we shot we heard him

clap up the stairs we got ready to bounce then his Hannah was on a doorknob

he paused and for a second it seemed like he might have figured us out but he came in and flicked on the light and we

rushed out behind the curtain tackling him into the hallway and onto the floor mom sat on his chest and we took him

everywhere he laughed I thought thoroughly all out laugh kicking his leg

saying no no no laughing and laughing until

he was wheezing and there were tears in his eyes but even there we kept on tickling poking our fingers into his

thighs and tickling his feet all of us laughing making as much noise as we

could but no one as loud as pops no no no he said crying out loud

crying now and laughing still I can't breathe all right mom said that's enough

but it wasn't enough our towels her slip-off and blood pumped through our naked bodies Our Hands shook with energy

we were alive it was not enough we wanted more we started tickling matu

started poking her and she clapsed on to Pop's chest and covered her head and and

he wrapped his arms around her there are many steps man my heart on the back it sounded so sorifying the whack of his

palm on her skin you're supposed to come find us he said sure and I was waiting

for some sign of trouble waiting for paps to react threatening him hit him something we stole their hunched and alert like

startled cats but nothing came Manny slap her back again and still nothing silence ma only moved both her

hands to Pop's waist her hair covered her faces the faces and we understood we could do

this that this will be allowed and never spoke enough she will kick pop style as

hard as he would he said yeah he said you're supposed to find us I joined in and kicking for pops by

hirima I felt dull and mean and perfect then we were all three Kick Kicking and

slapping at once and it didn't say a word it didn't even move the oldest noise was the noise of the skin and

impact and breath and our protest why didn't you come and find us why

didn't you come what did you do what you're supposed to do come and find us why didn't y'all

because you're bad bad bad bad why don't you do right why can't why

can't you do right we hate you come and find us we hate you everyone hates you you better come and find us next time

next time you better come we hit and kept on hitting we're allowed to be what

we were fighting and virtual little animals crawling at what we needed
